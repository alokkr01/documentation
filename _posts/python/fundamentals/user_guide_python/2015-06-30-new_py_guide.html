<p>You've just finished the <a href="https://plot.ly/python/getting-started"><code>Getting Started document</code></a>, and are looking to find out more. In this guide, we'll go through some of the internals of Plotly, as well as some tips and general practices that will allow you generate amazing data visualizations in no time.</p>

<h3 id="What-is-Plotly?">What is Plotly?<a class="anchor-link" href="#What-is-Plotly?">&#182;</a></h3><p>Plotly at its core is a data visualization toolbox. Under every plotly graph is a JSON object, which is a dictionary like data structure. By changing the values of some keywords in this object, we can get vastly different and ever more detailed plots. Let's start with a basic example to better understand how plots are created with the Plotly Python Library. We'll go into more detail regarding the different parts as we move forward.</p>

<h3 id="Working-with-the-Python-API">Working with the Python API<a class="anchor-link" href="#Working-with-the-Python-API">&#182;</a></h3><p>The Python API is a package designed to interact with the <code>Plotly.js</code> library in order to allow Python users to create plots in their preferred environment. This way, the package will provide functions and graph objects that will simplify the process of generating plots, which would amount to properly defining keywords in a JSON object (as seen above). To this end, the Python API provides functions and graph objects which will allow us to create our plots functionally. So let's break this down.</p>
<p>These are the two main modules that we will need in order to generate our Plotly graphs.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>plotly.plotly</code> contains the functions that will help us communicate with the Plotly servers</li>
<li><code>plotly.graph_objs</code> contains the functions that will generate graph objects for us.</li>

<p>In no time you will be able to figure out how to create plots the way you want them, and then share them with others. Let's take a quick look at how we would define the required objects for generatting a scatterplot comparing life expectancies and GDP per capital between two different continents.</p>

<p><code>go.Scatter</code> defines a trace producing a scatter plot. It also defines the data that we want to be plotted, which are 3 data points (1,4), (2,5), (3,6), as well as a miriad of specifications related to plotting this data. In this example we wanted the points to be plotted as hollow x's with lines joining them, all in red. To add another Scatter object to our data list, we need to define a new Scatter object, and include it inside our data object.</p>

<p>After viewing the outputs of these functions (ie: the objects), we can see that they are just lists or dictionaries. But they're a little more than that. Though they do inherit properties from dictionaries (traces, and layout) and lists (figure), they provide a bit more functionality as we'll soon see. Not to mention the fact that it's much simpler to create plots in this functional fashion compared to manually writing up a dictionary.</p>

 |          that may be specified as:
 |            - A list or tuple of trace instances
 |              (e.g. [Scatter(...), Bar(...)])
 |            - A list or tuple of dicts of string/value properties where:
 |              - The &#39;type&#39; property specifies the trace type

 |      
 |              - All remaining properties are passed to the constructor of
 |                the specified trace type
 |      
 |              (e.g. [{&#39;type&#39;: &#39;scatter&#39;, ...}, {&#39;type&#39;: &#39;bar, ...}])
 |          
 |      layout
 |          The &#39;layout&#39; property is an instance of Layout
 |          that may be specified as:
 |            - An instance of plotly.graph_objs.Layout
 |            - A dict of string/value properties that will be passed
 |              to the Layout constructor
 |      
 |              Supported dict properties:
 |                  
 |                  angularaxis
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.AngularAxis instance
 |                      or dict with compatible properties
 |                  annotations
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Annotation instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  annotationdefaults
 |                      When used in a template (as
 |                      layout.template.layout.annotationdefaults),
 |                      sets the default property values to use for
 |                      elements of layout.annotations
 |                  autosize
 |                      Determines whether or not a layout width or
 |                      height that has been left undefined by the user
 |                      is initialized on each relayout. Note that,
 |                      regardless of this attribute, an undefined
 |                      layout width or height is always initialized on
 |                      the first call to plot.
 |                  bargap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      adjacent location coordinates.
 |                  bargroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      the same location coordinate.
 |                  barmode
 |                      Determines how bars at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. With
 |                      &#34;stack&#34;, the bars are stacked on top of one
 |                      another With &#34;relative&#34;, the bars are stacked
 |                      on top of one another, with negative values
 |                      below the axis, positive values above With
 |                      &#34;group&#34;, the bars are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location.
 |                      With &#34;overlay&#34;, the bars are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to an &#34;opacity&#34; to see
 |                      multiple bars.
 |                  barnorm
 |                      Sets the normalization for bar traces on the
 |                      graph. With &#34;fraction&#34;, the value of each bar
 |                      is divided by the sum of all values at that
 |                      location coordinate. &#34;percent&#34; is the same but
 |                      multiplied by 100 to show percentages.
 |                  boxgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of adjacent location coordinates. Has no effect
 |                      on traces that have &#34;width&#34; set.
 |                  boxgroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between boxes
 |                      of the same location coordinate. Has no effect
 |                      on traces that have &#34;width&#34; set.
 |                  boxmode
 |                      Determines how boxes at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. If
 |                      &#34;group&#34;, the boxes are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location. If
 |                      &#34;overlay&#34;, the boxes are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to set &#34;opacity&#34; to see
 |                      them multiple boxes. Has no effect on traces
 |                      that have &#34;width&#34; set.
 |                  calendar
 |                      Sets the default calendar system to use for
 |                      interpreting and displaying dates throughout
 |                      the plot.
 |                  clickmode
 |                      Determines the mode of single click
 |                      interactions. &#34;event&#34; is the default value and
 |                      emits the `plotly_click` event. In addition
 |                      this mode emits the `plotly_selected` event in
 |                      drag modes &#34;lasso&#34; and &#34;select&#34;, but with no
 |                      event data attached (kept for compatibility
 |                      reasons). The &#34;select&#34; flag enables selecting
 |                      single data points via click. This mode also
 |                      supports persistent selections, meaning that
 |                      pressing Shift while clicking, adds to /
 |                      subtracts from an existing selection. &#34;select&#34;
 |                      with `hovermode`: &#34;x&#34; can be confusing,
 |                      consider explicitly setting `hovermode`:
 |                      &#34;closest&#34; when using this feature. Selection
 |                      events are sent accordingly as long as &#34;event&#34;
 |                      flag is set as well. When the &#34;event&#34; flag is
 |                      missing, `plotly_click` and `plotly_selected`
 |                      events are not fired.
 |                  coloraxis
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Coloraxis instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  colorscale
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Colorscale instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  colorway
 |                      Sets the default trace colors.
 |                  datarevision
 |                      If provided, a changed value tells
 |                      `Plotly.react` that one or more data arrays has
 |                      changed. This way you can modify arrays in-
 |                      place rather than making a complete new copy
 |                      for an incremental change. If NOT provided,
 |                      `Plotly.react` assumes that data arrays are
 |                      being treated as immutable, thus any data array
 |                      with a different identity from its predecessor
 |                      contains new data.
 |                  direction
 |                      Legacy polar charts are deprecated! Please
 |                      switch to &#34;polar&#34; subplots. Sets the direction
 |                      corresponding to positive angles in legacy
 |                      polar charts.
 |                  dragmode
 |                      Determines the mode of drag interactions.
 |                      &#34;select&#34; and &#34;lasso&#34; apply only to scatter
 |                      traces with markers or text. &#34;orbit&#34; and
 |                      &#34;turntable&#34; apply only to 3D scenes.
 |                  editrevision
 |                      Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
 |                      `editable: true` configuration, other than
 |                      trace names and axis titles. Defaults to
 |                      `layout.uirevision`.
 |                  extendfunnelareacolors
 |                      If `true`, the funnelarea slice colors (whether
 |                      given by `funnelareacolorway` or inherited from
 |                      `colorway`) will be extended to three times its
 |                      original length by first repeating every color
 |                      20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing
 |                      the same color when you have many slices, but
 |                      you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided
 |                      in the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never
 |                      extended.
 |                  extendpiecolors
 |                      If `true`, the pie slice colors (whether given
 |                      by `piecolorway` or inherited from `colorway`)
 |                      will be extended to three times its original
 |                      length by first repeating every color 20%
 |                      lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing
 |                      the same color when you have many slices, but
 |                      you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided
 |                      in the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never
 |                      extended.
 |                  extendsunburstcolors
 |                      If `true`, the sunburst slice colors (whether
 |                      given by `sunburstcolorway` or inherited from
 |                      `colorway`) will be extended to three times its
 |                      original length by first repeating every color
 |                      20% lighter then each color 20% darker. This is
 |                      intended to reduce the likelihood of reusing
 |                      the same color when you have many slices, but
 |                      you can set `false` to disable. Colors provided
 |                      in the trace, using `marker.colors`, are never
 |                      extended.
 |                  font
 |                      Sets the global font. Note that fonts used in
 |                      traces and other layout components inherit from
 |                      the global font.
 |                  funnelareacolorway
 |                      Sets the default funnelarea slice colors.
 |                      Defaults to the main `colorway` used for trace
 |                      colors. If you specify a new list here it can
 |                      still be extended with lighter and darker
 |                      colors, see `extendfunnelareacolors`.
 |                  funnelgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      adjacent location coordinates.
 |                  funnelgroupgap
 |                      Sets the gap (in plot fraction) between bars of
 |                      the same location coordinate.
 |                  funnelmode
 |                      Determines how bars at the same location
 |                      coordinate are displayed on the graph. With
 |                      &#34;stack&#34;, the bars are stacked on top of one
 |                      another With &#34;group&#34;, the bars are plotted next
 |                      to one another centered around the shared
 |                      location. With &#34;overlay&#34;, the bars are plotted
 |                      over one another, you might need to an
 |                      &#34;opacity&#34; to see multiple bars.
 |                  geo

 |                  height
 |                      Sets the plot&#39;s height (in px).
 |                  hiddenlabels
 |                      hiddenlabels is the funnelarea &amp; pie chart
 |                      analog of visible:&#39;legendonly&#39; but it can
 |                      contain many labels, and can simultaneously
 |                      hide slices from several pies/funnelarea charts
 |                  hiddenlabelssrc
 |                      Sets the source reference on plot.ly for

 |                  hoverdistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to add hover labels (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). This is
 |                      only a real distance for hovering on point-like
 |                      objects, like scatter points. For area-like
 |                      objects (bars, scatter fills, etc) hovering is
 |                      on inside the area and off outside, but these
 |                      objects will not supersede hover on point-like
 |                      objects in case of conflict.

 |                  hovermode
 |                      Determines the mode of hover interactions. If
 |                      `clickmode` includes the &#34;select&#34; flag,
 |                      `hovermode` defaults to &#34;closest&#34;. If
 |                      `clickmode` lacks the &#34;select&#34; flag, it
 |                      defaults to &#34;x&#34; or &#34;y&#34; (depending on the
 |                      trace&#39;s `orientation` value) for plots based on
 |                      cartesian coordinates. For anything else the

 |                      `label` text all support `meta`. One can access
 |                      `meta` fields using template strings:
 |                      `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index of the
 |                      `meta` item in question. `meta` can also be an
 |                      object for example `{key: value}` which can be
 |                      accessed %{meta[key]}.
 |                  metasrc
 |                      Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta

 |                  paper_bgcolor
 |                      Sets the color of paper where the graph is
 |                      drawn.
 |                  piecolorway
 |                      Sets the default pie slice colors. Defaults to
 |                      the main `colorway` used for trace colors. If
 |                      you specify a new list here it can still be

 |                      When &#34;dragmode&#34; is set to &#34;select&#34;, this limits
 |                      the selection of the drag to horizontal,
 |                      vertical or diagonal. &#34;h&#34; only allows
 |                      horizontal selection, &#34;v&#34; only vertical, &#34;d&#34;
 |                      only diagonal and &#34;any&#34; sets no limit.
 |                  selectionrevision
 |                      Controls persistence of user-driven changes in
 |                      selected points from all traces.
 |                  separators
 |                      Sets the decimal and thousand separators. For
 |                      example, *. * puts a &#39;.&#39; before decimals and a
 |                      space between thousands. In English locales,
 |                      dflt is &#34;.,&#34; but other locales may alter this
 |                      default.
 |                  shapes
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Shape instance or dict
 |                      with compatible properties

 |                      layout.shapes
 |                  showlegend
 |                      Determines whether or not a legend is drawn.
 |                      Default is `true` if there is a trace to show
 |                      and any of these: a) Two or more traces would
 |                      by default be shown in the legend. b) One pie
 |                      trace is shown in the legend. c) One trace is
 |                      explicitly given with `showlegend: true`.
 |                  sliders
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Slider instance or
 |                      dict with compatible properties
 |                  sliderdefaults
 |                      When used in a template (as
 |                      layout.template.layout.sliderdefaults), sets
 |                      the default property values to use for elements
 |                      of layout.sliders
 |                  spikedistance
 |                      Sets the default distance (in pixels) to look
 |                      for data to draw spikelines to (-1 means no
 |                      cutoff, 0 means no looking for data). As with
 |                      hoverdistance, distance does not apply to area-
 |                      like objects. In addition, some objects can be
 |                      hovered on but will not generate spikelines,
 |                      such as scatter fills.
 |                  sunburstcolorway
 |                      Sets the default sunburst slice colors.
 |                      Defaults to the main `colorway` used for trace
 |                      colors. If you specify a new list here it can
 |                      still be extended with lighter and darker
 |                      colors, see `extendsunburstcolors`.
 |                  template
 |                      Default attributes to be applied to the plot.
 |                      This should be a dict with format: `{&#39;layout&#39;:
 |                      layoutTemplate, &#39;data&#39;: {trace_type:
 |                      [traceTemplate, ...], ...}}` where
 |                      `layoutTemplate` is a dict matching the
 |                      structure of `figure.layout` and
 |                      `traceTemplate` is a dict matching the
 |                      structure of the trace with type `trace_type`
 |                      (e.g. &#39;scatter&#39;). Alternatively, this may be
 |                      specified as an instance of
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Template.  Trace
 |                      templates are applied cyclically to traces of
 |                      each type. Container arrays (eg `annotations`)
 |                      have special handling: An object ending in
 |                      `defaults` (eg `annotationdefaults`) is applied
 |                      to each array item. But if an item has a
 |                      `templateitemname` key we look in the template
 |                      array for an item with matching `name` and
 |                      apply that instead. If no matching `name` is
 |                      found we mark the item invisible. Any named
 |                      template item not referenced is appended to the
 |                      end of the array, so this can be used to add a
 |                      watermark annotation or a logo image, for
 |                      example. To omit one of these items on the
 |                      plot, make an item with matching
 |                      `templateitemname` and `visible: false`.
 |                  ternary
 |                      plotly.graph_objs.layout.Ternary instance or

 |                      Deprecated: Please use layout.title.font
 |                      instead. Sets the title font. Note that the
 |                      title&#39;s font used to be customized by the now
 |                      deprecated `titlefont` attribute.
 |                  transition
 |                      Sets transition options used during
 |                      Plotly.react updates.
 |                  uirevision
 |                      Used to allow user interactions with the plot
 |                      to persist after `Plotly.react` calls that are
 |                      unaware of these interactions. If `uirevision`
 |                      is omitted, or if it is given and it changed
 |                      from the previous `Plotly.react` call, the
 |                      exact new figure is used. If `uirevision` is
 |                      truthy and did NOT change, any attribute that
 |                      has been affected by user interactions and did
 |                      not receive a different value in the new figure
 |                      will keep the interaction value.
 |                      `layout.uirevision` attribute serves as the
 |                      default for `uirevision` attributes in various
 |                      sub-containers. For finer control you can set
 |                      these sub-attributes directly. For example, if
 |                      your app separately controls the data on the x
 |                      and y axes you might set
 |                      `xaxis.uirevision=*time*` and
 |                      `yaxis.uirevision=*cost*`. Then if only the y
 |                      data is changed, you can update
 |                      `yaxis.uirevision=*quantity*` and the y axis
 |                      range will reset but the x axis range will
 |                      retain any user-driven zoom.

 |                      &#34;group&#34;, the violins are plotted next to one
 |                      another centered around the shared location. If
 |                      &#34;overlay&#34;, the violins are plotted over one
 |                      another, you might need to set &#34;opacity&#34; to see

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.area.Hoverlabel instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.area.Marker instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      r
 |          Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the
 |          &#34;barpolar&#34; trace type. Sets the radial coordinates for
 |          legacy polar chart only.
 |      rsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.area.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      t
 |          Area traces are deprecated! Please switch to the
 |          &#34;barpolar&#34; trace type. Sets the angular coordinates for
 |          legacy polar chart only.
 |      tsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      base
 |          Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
 |          units). In &#34;stack&#34; or &#34;relative&#34; barmode, traces that
 |          set &#34;base&#34; will be excluded and drawn in &#34;overlay&#34; mode
 |          instead.
 |      basesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  base .
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
 |          subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
 |          and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
 |          `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
 |      constraintext
 |          Constrain the size of text inside or outside a bar to
 |          be no larger than the bar itself.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx

 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc

 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      insidetextanchor
 |          Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
 |          points in `textposition` &#34;inside&#34; mode.
 |      insidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc

 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
 |          axis units). In &#34;group&#34; barmode, traces that set
 |          &#34;offset&#34; will be excluded and drawn in &#34;overlay&#34; mode
 |          instead.
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      offsetsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  offset .
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation

 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.bar.Selected instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.bar.Stream instance or dict with

 |          angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
 |          bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
 |          labels vertically. With &#34;auto&#34; the texts may
 |          automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
 |          in bars.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &#34;inside&#34;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &#34;outside&#34; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &#34;auto&#34; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      tsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.bar.Unselected instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width

 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in

 |          with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a polar subplot. If &#34;polar&#34; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.polar`. If &#34;polar2&#34;, the data
 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each bar. If a
 |          single string, the same string appears over all bars.

 |      theta
 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &#34;theta&#34; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &#34;linear&#34; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.barpolar.Unselected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar angular width (in &#34;thetaunit&#34; units).
 |      widthsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  width .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |

 |      Add a new Box trace
 |      
 |      In vertical (horizontal) box plots, statistics are computed

 |      box per distinct x (y) value is drawn If no `x` (`y`) list is
 |      provided, a single box is drawn. That box position is then
 |      positioned with with `name` or with `x0` (`y0`) if provided.
 |      Each box spans from quartile 1 (Q1) to quartile 3 (Q3). The
 |      second quartile (Q2) is marked by a line inside the box. By
 |      default, the whiskers correspond to the box&#39; edges +/- 1.5
 |      times the interquartile range (IQR: Q3-Q1), see &#34;boxpoints&#34; for

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.

 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each sample
 |          value. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          visible).
 |      whiskerwidth
 |          Sets the width of the whiskers relative to the box&#39;
 |          width. For example, with 1, the whiskers are as wide as
 |          the box(es).
 |      width
 |          Sets the width of the box in data coordinate If 0
 |          (default value) the width is automatically selected
 |          based on the positions of other box traces in the same
 |          subplot.

 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.carpet.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          A two dimensional array of x coordinates at each carpet
 |          point. If ommitted, the plot is a cheater plot and the
 |          xaxis is hidden by default.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          A two dimensional array of y coordinates at each carpet
 |          point.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These
 |              properties are specified in the specs argument to
 |              make_subplots. See the make_subplots docstring for more info.

 |      value in `z` are set in `locations`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------

 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.choropleth.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties

 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      geo
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s geospatial
 |          coordinates and a geographic map. If &#34;geo&#34; (the default
 |          value), the geospatial coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.geo`. If &#34;geo2&#34;, the geospatial coordinates
 |          refer to `layout.geo2`, and so on.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.choropleth.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .

 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      locationmode
 |          Determines the set of locations used to match entries
 |          in `locations` to regions on the map.
 |      locations
 |          Sets the coordinates via location IDs or names. See
 |          `locationmode` for more info.
 |      locationssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  locations .
 |      marker

 |          with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.choropleth.Selected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.choropleth.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each location.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.choropleth.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      z
 |          Sets the color values.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here u/v/w norm) or the

 |          must be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,

 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified

 |          example &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Same as `text`.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      lighting

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      sizemode
 |          Determines whether `sizeref` is set as a &#34;scaled&#34; (i.e
 |          unitless) scalar (normalized by the max u/v/w norm in
 |          the vector field) or as &#34;absolute&#34; value (in the same
 |          units as the vector field).
 |      sizeref
 |          Adjusts the cone size scaling. The size of the cones is
 |          determined by their u/v/w norm multiplied a factor and
 |          `sizeref`. This factor (computed internally)
 |          corresponds to the minimum &#34;time&#34; to travel across two
 |          successive x/y/z positions at the average velocity of
 |          those two successive positions. All cones in a given
 |          trace use the same factor. With `sizemode` set to
 |          &#34;scaled&#34;, `sizeref` is unitless, its default value is
 |          0.5 With `sizemode` set to &#34;absolute&#34;, `sizeref` has
 |          the same units as the u/v/w vector field, its the
 |          default value is half the sample&#39;s maximum vector norm.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.cone.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the cones. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      u
 |          Sets the x components of the vector field.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |      Add a new Contour trace
 |      
 |      The data from which contour lines are computed is set in `z`.
 |      Data in `z` must be a 2D list of numbers. Say that `z` has N
 |      rows and M columns, then by default, these N rows correspond to
 |      N y coordinates (set in `y` or auto-generated) and the M
 |      columns correspond to M x coordinates (set in `x` or auto-
 |      generated). By setting `transpose` to True, the above behavior
 |      is flipped.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of
 |          contour levels can be set in `ncontours`. If False, set
 |          the contour level attributes in `contours`.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contour.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.

 |          Defaults to a half-transparent variant of the line
 |          color, marker color, or marker line color, whichever is
 |          available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contour.Hoverlabel instance or dict

 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the

 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .

 |      line
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contour.Line instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`

 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contour.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      xtype
 |          If &#34;array&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by

 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes

 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.

 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in

 |          available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

 |          with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.contourcarpet.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible

 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  z .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.

 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      insidetextanchor
 |          Determines if texts are kept at center or start/end
 |          points in `textposition` &#34;inside&#34; mode.
 |      insidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.funnel.Marker instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
 |          axis units). In &#34;group&#34; barmode, traces that set
 |          &#34;offset&#34; will be excluded and drawn in &#34;overlay&#34; mode
 |          instead.
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the funnels. With &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;),
 |          the value of the each bar spans along the vertical
 |          (horizontal). By default funnels are tend to be
 |          oriented horizontally; unless only &#34;y&#34; array is
 |          presented or orientation is set to &#34;v&#34;. Also regarding
 |          graphs including only &#39;horizontal&#39; funnels, &#34;autorange&#34;
 |          on the &#34;y-axis&#34; are set to &#34;reversed&#34;.
 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.funnel.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
 |          bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
 |          labels vertically. With &#34;auto&#34; the texts may
 |          automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
 |          in bars.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
 |          In the case of having multiple funnels, percentages &amp;
 |          totals are computed separately (per trace).
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &#34;inside&#34;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &#34;outside&#34; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &#34;auto&#34; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These
 |              properties are specified in the specs argument to
 |              make_subplots. See the make_subplots docstring for more info.

 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each sector.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears for all
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order of this trace&#39;s sectors. To be seen,
 |          trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object

 |          and `dlabel` the step.
 |      labels
 |          Sets the sector labels. If `labels` entries are
 |          duplicated, we sum associated `values` or simply count
 |          occurrences if `values` is not provided. For other

 |          non-empty entry among all occurrences of the label.
 |      labelssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  labels .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when

 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the

 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      scalegroup
 |          If there are multiple funnelareas that should be sized
 |          according to their totals, link them by providing a
 |          non-empty group id here shared by every trace in the
 |          same group.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.funnelarea.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each sector. If
 |          trace `textinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag, these elements
 |          will be seen on the chart. If trace `hoverinfo`
 |          contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set,
 |          these elements will be seen in the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `textinfo`.
 |      textinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `textinfo`.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      title
 |          plotly.graph_objs.funnelarea.Title instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      values
 |          Sets the values of the sectors. If omitted, we count
 |          occurrences of each label.
 |      valuessrc

 |      Add a new Heatmap trace
 |      
 |      The data that describes the heatmap value-to-color mapping is
 |      set in `z`. Data in `z` can either be a 2D list of values
 |      (ragged or not) or a 1D array of values. In the case where `z`
 |      is a 2D list, say that `z` has N rows and M columns. Then, by
 |      default, the resulting heatmap will have N partitions along the
 |      y axis and M partitions along the x axis. In other words, the
 |      i-th row/ j-th column cell in `z` is mapped to the i-th
 |      partition of the y axis (starting from the bottom of the plot)
 |      and the j-th partition of the x-axis (starting from the left of
 |      the plot). This behavior can be flipped by using `transpose`.
 |      Moreover, `x` (`y`) can be provided with M or M+1 (N or N+1)
 |      elements. If M (N), then the coordinates correspond to the
 |      center of the heatmap cells and the cells have equal width. If
 |      M+1 (N+1), then the coordinates correspond to the edges of the
 |      heatmap cells. In the case where `z` is a 1D list, the x and y
 |      coordinates must be provided in `x` and `y` respectively to
 |      form data triplets.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.heatmap.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties

 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          values) in the `z` data are filled in.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.heatmap.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc

 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.heatmap.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as

 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.

 |          &#34;x&#34; (the default behavior when `x` is provided). If
 |          &#34;scaled&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by &#34;x0&#34;
 |          and &#34;dx&#34; (the default behavior when `x` is not
 |          provided).
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      ygap
 |          Sets the vertical gap (in pixels) between bricks.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      ytype
 |          If &#34;array&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by
 |          &#34;y&#34; (the default behavior when `y` is provided) If
 |          &#34;scaled&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by &#34;y0&#34;
 |          and &#34;dy&#34; (the default behavior when `y` is not
 |          provided)
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting
 |          mini-languages which are very similar to those in
 |          Python. See: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/maste
 |          r/README.md#locale_format
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmax` must

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.heatmapgl.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      transpose
 |          Transposes the z data.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If

 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      xtype
 |          If &#34;array&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by
 |          &#34;x&#34; (the default behavior when `x` is provided). If
 |          &#34;scaled&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s x coordinates are given by &#34;x0&#34;
 |          and &#34;dx&#34; (the default behavior when `x` is not
 |          provided).
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the

 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      ytype
 |          If &#34;array&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by

 |          &#34;scaled&#34;, the heatmap&#39;s y coordinates are given by &#34;y0&#34;
 |          and &#34;dy&#34; (the default behavior when `y` is not
 |          provided)
 |      z
 |          Sets the z data.
 |      zauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here in `z`) or the
 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as in `z`. Has no
 |          effect when `zauto` is `false`.
 |      zmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should

 |      Add a new Histogram trace
 |      
 |      The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in
 |      `x` for vertically spanning histograms and in `y` for
 |      horizontally spanning histograms. Binning options are set
 |      `xbins` and `ybins` respectively if no aggregation data is

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      bingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have
 |          compatible bin settings. Note that traces on the same
 |          subplot and with the same &#34;orientation&#34; under `barmode`
 |          &#34;stack&#34;, &#34;relative&#34; and &#34;group&#34; are forced into the
 |          same bingroup, Using `bingroup`, traces under `barmode`
 |          &#34;overlay&#34; and on different axes (of the same axis type)
 |          can have compatible bin settings. Note that histogram
 |          and histogram2d* trace can share the same `bingroup`
 |      cumulative
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram.Cumulative instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      error_x
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram.ErrorX instance or dict

 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram.ErrorY instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &#34;count&#34;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &#34;sum&#34;, &#34;avg&#34;, &#34;min&#34;, &#34;max&#34;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &#34;&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &#34;percent&#34; / &#34;probability&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &#34;density&#34;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).

 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available. variable `binNumber` Anything contained in
 |          tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`

 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.

 |          the this trace&#39;s coordinates.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |      Add a new Histogram2d trace
 |      
 |      The sample data from which statistics are computed is set in
 |      `x` and `y` (where `x` and `y` represent marginal
 |      distributions, binning is set in `xbins` and `ybins` in this
 |      case) or `z` (where `z` represent the 2D distribution and
 |      binning set, binning is set by `x` and `y` in this case). The
 |      resulting distribution is visualized as a heatmap.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      bingroup
 |          Set the `xbingroup` and `ybingroup` default prefix For
 |          example, setting a `bingroup` of 1 on two histogram2d
 |          traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match
 |          separately.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &#34;count&#34;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &#34;sum&#34;, &#34;avg&#34;, &#34;min&#34;, &#34;max&#34;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &#34;&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &#34;percent&#34; / &#34;probability&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &#34;density&#34;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available. variable `z` Anything contained in tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;` is displayed in the secondary box, for
 |          example &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the
 |          secondary box completely, use an empty tag
 |          `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.Marker instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      nbinsx
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `ybins.size` is provided.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the sample data to be binned on the x axis.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have
 |          compatible x-bin settings. Using `xbingroup`,
 |          histogram2d and histogram2dcontour traces  (on axes of
 |          the same axis type) can have compatible x-bin settings.
 |          Note that the same `xbingroup` value can be used to set
 |          (1D) histogram `bingroup`
 |      xbins
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.XBins instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xgap
 |          Sets the horizontal gap (in pixels) between bricks.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the sample data to be binned on the y axis.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have
 |          compatible y-bin settings. Using `ybingroup`,
 |          histogram2d and histogram2dcontour traces  (on axes of
 |          the same axis type) can have compatible y-bin settings.
 |          Note that the same `ybingroup` value can be used to set
 |          (1D) histogram `bingroup`
 |      ybins
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2d.YBins instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties

 |          bounds set in `zmin` and `zmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `zmin` and `zmax` are set by the user.
 |      zhoverformat
 |          Sets the hover text formatting rule using d3 formatting
 |          mini-languages which are very similar to those in
 |          Python. See: https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/maste
 |          r/README.md#locale_format
 |      zmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as in `z` and if set, `zmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autobinx
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobinx` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobinx: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `xbins` accordingly before deleting `autobinx`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autobiny
 |          Obsolete: since v1.42 each bin attribute is auto-
 |          determined separately and `autobiny` is not needed.
 |          However, we accept `autobiny: true` or `false` and will
 |          update `ybins` accordingly before deleting `autobiny`
 |          from the trace.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      autocontour
 |          Determines whether or not the contour level attributes
 |          are picked by an algorithm. If True, the number of

 |          the contour level attributes in `contours`.
 |      bingroup
 |          Set the `xbingroup` and `ybingroup` default prefix For
 |          example, setting a `bingroup` of 1 on two histogram2d
 |          traces will make them their x-bins and y-bins match
 |          separately.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.ColorBar instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`zmin` and `zmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      contours
 |          plotly.graph_objs.histogram2dcontour.Contours instance
 |          or dict with compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      histfunc
 |          Specifies the binning function used for this histogram
 |          trace. If &#34;count&#34;, the histogram values are computed by
 |          counting the number of values lying inside each bin. If
 |          &#34;sum&#34;, &#34;avg&#34;, &#34;min&#34;, &#34;max&#34;, the histogram values are
 |          computed using the sum, the average, the minimum or the
 |          maximum of the values lying inside each bin
 |          respectively.
 |      histnorm
 |          Specifies the type of normalization used for this
 |          histogram trace. If &#34;&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the number of occurrences (i.e. the
 |          number of data points lying inside the bins). If
 |          &#34;percent&#34; / &#34;probability&#34;, the span of each bar
 |          corresponds to the percentage / fraction of occurrences
 |          with respect to the total number of sample points
 |          (here, the sum of all bin HEIGHTS equals 100% / 1). If
 |          &#34;density&#34;, the span of each bar corresponds to the
 |          number of occurrences in a bin divided by the size of
 |          the bin interval (here, the sum of all bin AREAS equals
 |          the total number of sample points). If *probability
 |          density*, the area of each bar corresponds to the
 |          probability that an event will fall into the
 |          corresponding bin (here, the sum of all bin AREAS
 |          equals 1).
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover

 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc

 |      nbinsx
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `xbins.size` is provided.
 |      nbinsy
 |          Specifies the maximum number of desired bins. This
 |          value will be used in an algorithm that will decide the
 |          optimal bin size such that the histogram best
 |          visualizes the distribution of the data. Ignored if
 |          `ybins.size` is provided.
 |      ncontours
 |          Sets the maximum number of contour levels. The actual
 |          number of contours will be chosen automatically to be
 |          less than or equal to the value of `ncontours`. Has an
 |          effect only if `autocontour` is True or if
 |          `contours.size` is missing.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `zmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `zmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      stream

 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as

 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbingroup
 |          Set a group of histogram traces which will have
 |          compatible x-bin settings. Using `xbingroup`,
 |          histogram2d and histogram2dcontour traces  (on axes of
 |          the same axis type) can have compatible x-bin settings.
 |          Note that the same `xbingroup` value can be used to set
 |          (1D) histogram `bingroup`

 |          be set as well.
 |      zmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `zmin` and/or `zmax` to be equidistant to this point.

 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.

 |          plotly.graph_objs.isosurface.Surface instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          Sets the 4th dimension (value) of the vertices.
 |      valuesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  value .
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          Sets the X coordinates of the vertices on X axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

 |      Add a new Mesh3d trace
 |      
 |      Draws sets of triangles with coordinates given by three
 |      1-dimensional arrays in `x`, `y`, `z` and (1) a sets of `i`,
 |      `j`, `k` indices (2) Delaunay triangulation or (3) the Alpha-
 |      shape algorithm or (4) the Convex-hull algorithm
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alphahull
 |          Determines how the mesh surface triangles are derived
 |          from the set of vertices (points) represented by the
 |          `x`, `y` and `z` arrays, if the `i`, `j`, `k` arrays
 |          are not supplied. For general use of `mesh3d` it is
 |          preferred that `i`, `j`, `k` are supplied. If &#34;-1&#34;,
 |          Delaunay triangulation is used, which is mainly
 |          suitable if the mesh is a single, more or less layer
 |          surface that is perpendicular to `delaunayaxis`. In
 |          case the `delaunayaxis` intersects the mesh surface at
 |          more than one point it will result triangles that are
 |          very long in the dimension of `delaunayaxis`. If &#34;&gt;0&#34;,
 |          the alpha-shape algorithm is used. In this case, the
 |          positive `alphahull` value signals the use of the
 |          alpha-shape algorithm, _and_ its value acts as the
 |          parameter for the mesh fitting. If 0,  the convex-hull
 |          algorithm is used. It is suitable for convex bodies or
 |          if the intention is to enclose the `x`, `y` and `z`
 |          point set into a convex hull.
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here `intensity`) or
 |          the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to
 |          `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmin`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as `intensity`. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `intensity` and if set, `cmax`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      color
 |          Sets the color of the whole mesh
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.ColorBar instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H
 |          ot,Blackbody,Earth,Electric,Viridis,Cividis.
 |      contour
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.Contour instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      delaunayaxis
 |          Sets the Delaunay axis, which is the axis that is
 |          perpendicular to the surface of the Delaunay
 |          triangulation. It has an effect if `i`, `j`, `k` are
 |          not provided and `alphahull` is set to indicate
 |          Delaunay triangulation.
 |      facecolor
 |          Sets the color of each face Overrides &#34;color&#34; and
 |          &#34;vertexcolor&#34;.
 |      facecolorsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  facecolor .
 |      flatshading
 |          Determines whether or not normal smoothing is applied
 |          to the meshes, creating meshes with an angular, low-
 |          poly look via flat reflections.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.mesh3d.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .

 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the &#34;first&#34; vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `i[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `i` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the first vertex of a triangle.
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an

 |          j[m], k[m]}`  together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `j[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `j` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the second vertex of a triangle.
 |      jsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  j .
 |      k
 |          A vector of vertex indices, i.e. integer values between
 |          0 and the length of the vertex vectors, representing
 |          the &#34;third&#34; vertex of a triangle. For example, `{i[m],
 |          j[m], k[m]}` together represent face m (triangle m) in
 |          the mesh, where `k[m] = n` points to the triplet
 |          `{x[n], y[n], z[n]}` in the vertex arrays. Therefore,
 |          each element in `k` represents a point in space, which
 |          is the third vertex of a triangle.
 |      ksrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  k .

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`

 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and

 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),

 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showscale

 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      vertexcolor
 |          Sets the color of each vertex Overrides &#34;color&#34;. While
 |          Red, green and blue colors are in the range of 0 and
 |          255; in the case of having vertex color data in RGBA
 |          format, the alpha color should be normalized to be
 |          between 0 and 1.
 |      vertexcolorsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  vertexcolor .
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the X coordinates of the vertices. The nth element

 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y

 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`

 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          Sets the x coordinates. If absent, linear coordinate
 |          will be generated.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These

 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoveron
 |          Sets the hover interaction mode for the parcats
 |          diagram. If `category`, hover interaction take place
 |          per category. If `color`, hover interactions take place

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by

 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      labelfont
 |          Sets the font for the `dimension` labels.
 |      line

 |          compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .

 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xbounds
 |          Specify `xbounds` in the shape of `[xMin, xMax] to
 |          avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in
 |          conjunction with `xy` and `ybounds` for the performance
 |          benefits.
 |      xboundssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  xbounds .
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      xy
 |          Faster alternative to specifying `x` and `y`
 |          separately. If supplied, it must be a typed
 |          `Float32Array` array that represents points such that
 |          `xy[i * 2] = x[i]` and `xy[i * 2 + 1] = y[i]`
 |      xysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  xy .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ybounds
 |          Specify `ybounds` in the shape of `[yMin, yMax] to
 |          avoid looping through the `xy` typed array. Use it in
 |          conjunction with `xy` and `xbounds` for the performance
 |          benefits.
 |      yboundssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ybounds .
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These
 |              properties are specified in the specs argument to
 |              make_subplots. See the make_subplots docstring for more info.

 |      Add a new Sankey trace
 |      
 |      Sankey plots for network flow data analysis. The nodes are
 |      specified in `nodes` and the links between sources and targets
 |      in `links`. The colors are set in `nodes[i].color` and
 |      `links[i].color`, otherwise defaults are used.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arrangement
 |          If value is `snap` (the default), the node arrangement
 |          is assisted by automatic snapping of elements to
 |          preserve space between nodes specified via `nodepad`.
 |          If value is `perpendicular`, the nodes can only move
 |          along a line perpendicular to the flow. If value is
 |          `freeform`, the nodes can freely move on the plane. If
 |          value is `fixed`, the nodes are stationary.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      domain
 |          plotly.graph_objs.sankey.Domain instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired. Note that this attribute is
 |          superseded by `node.hoverinfo` and `node.hoverinfo` for
 |          nodes and links respectively.
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.sankey.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      link
 |          The links of the Sankey plot.
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      node
 |          The nodes of the Sankey plot.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the Sankey diagram.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.sankey.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font for node labels
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      valueformat
 |          Sets the value formatting rule using d3 formatting
 |          mini-language which is similar to those of Python. See 
 |          https://github.com/d3/d3-format/blob/master/README.md#l
 |          ocale_format
 |      valuesuffix
 |          Adds a unit to follow the value in the hover tooltip.
 |          Add a space if a separation is necessary from the
 |          value.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Scatter trace
 |      
 |      The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts,
 |      text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter
 |      point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on
 |      the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are
 |      achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to
 |      numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      error_x
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorX instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorY instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      groupnorm
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
 |          this `stackgroup`. With &#34;fraction&#34;, the value of each
 |          trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
 |          trace values at that location. &#34;percent&#34; is the same
 |          but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
 |          multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
 |          subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      line
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Line instance or dict with

 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Marker instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With &#34;v&#34;
 |          (&#34;h&#34;), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
 |          Also affects the default value of `fill`.

 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Selected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stackgaps
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
 |          which other traces in this group have data but this one
 |          does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
 |          locations. With &#34;interpolate&#34; we linearly interpolate
 |          between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
 |          beyond the existing values.
 |      stackgroup
 |          Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
 |          same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
 |          their x values if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34;). If blank or
 |          omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
 |          turns `fill` on by default, using &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;)
 |          if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34; (&#34;v&#34;) and sets the default
 |          `mode` to &#34;lines&#34; irrespective of point count. You can
 |          only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
 |          a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
 |          other traces in the same group. With multiple
 |          `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
 |          fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
 |          later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .

 |      tsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Unselected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If

 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the x coordinates.
 |      x0
 |          Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
 |          coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These
 |              properties are specified in the specs argument to

 |          items are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y,z)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than

 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showlegend

 |          Delaunay surface about the x, y, z respectively.
 |      surfacecolor
 |          Sets the surface fill color.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y,z)
 |          triplet. If a single string, the same string appears
 |          over all the data points. If an array of string, the
 |          items are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y,z)
 |          coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34;
 |          flag and &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be
 |          seen in the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter3d.Textfont instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  a .
 |      b
 |          Sets the b-axis coordinates.
 |      bsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  b .
 |      carpet
 |          An identifier for this carpet, so that `scattercarpet`
 |          and `scattercontour` traces can specify a carpet plot
 |          on which they lie
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. scatterternary has a subset
 |          of the options available to scatter. &#34;toself&#34; connects
 |          the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the
 |          trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          fills the space between two traces if one completely
 |          encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and
 |          behaves like &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it.
 |          &#34;tonext&#34; should not be used if one trace does not
 |          enclose the other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Hoverlabel instance or

 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b)
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of strings, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b). To
 |          be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      line
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Line instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties

 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Marker instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Selected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (a,b) point. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of strings, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b). If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattercarpet.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These
 |              properties are specified in the specs argument to
 |              make_subplots. See the make_subplots docstring for more info.

 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergeo.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair
 |          or item in `locations`. If a single string, the same
 |          string appears over all the data points. If an array of
 |          string, the items are mapped in order to the this
 |          trace&#39;s (lon,lat) or `locations` coordinates. If trace
 |          `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and &#34;hovertext&#34; is
 |          not set, these elements will be seen in the hover
 |          labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergeo.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Scattergl trace
 |      
 |      The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `x` and
 |      `y` using the WebGL plotting engine. Bubble charts are achieved
 |      by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to a numerical
 |      arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      error_x

 |          with compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.ErrorY instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.Hoverlabel instance or dict

 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup

 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.

 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.Selected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and

 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattergl.Unselected instance or dict

 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xcalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0
 |          Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
 |          coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ycalendar
 |          Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be

 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (lon,lat)
 |          pair If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (lon,lat)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      lat

 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover.

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      selected

 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattermapbox.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a mapbox subplot. If &#34;mapbox&#34; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.mapbox`. If &#34;mapbox2&#34;, the
 |          data refer to `layout.mapbox2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (lon,lat) pair
 |          If a single string, the same string appears over all
 |          the data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (lon,lat)
 |          coordinates. If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34;
 |          flag and &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be
 |          seen in the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the icon text font (color=mapbox.layer.paint.text-
 |          color, size=mapbox.layer.layout.text-size). Has an
 |          effect only when `type` is set to &#34;symbol&#34;.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scattermapbox.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Scatterpolar trace
 |      
 |      The scatterpolar trace type encompasses line charts, scatter
 |      charts, text charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates.
 |      The data visualized as scatter point or lines is set in `r`
 |      (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Text (appearing
 |      either on the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble
 |      charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or
 |      `marker.color` to numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. scatterpolar has a subset of
 |          the options available to scatter. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      line
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Line instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Marker instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      r
 |          Sets the radial coordinates
 |      r0
 |          Alternate to `r`. Builds a linear space of r
 |          coordinates. Use with `dr` where `r0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dr` the step.
 |      rsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Selected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a polar subplot. If &#34;polar&#34; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.polar`. If &#34;polar2&#34;, the data
 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      theta
 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &#34;theta&#34; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &#34;linear&#34; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolar.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |

 |      Add a new Scatterpolargl trace
 |      
 |      The scatterpolargl trace type encompasses line charts, scatter
 |      charts, and bubble charts in polar coordinates using the WebGL
 |      plotting engine. The data visualized as scatter point or lines
 |      is set in `r` (radial) and `theta` (angular) coordinates Bubble
 |      charts are achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or
 |      `marker.color` to numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dr
 |          Sets the r coordinate step.
 |      dtheta
 |          Sets the theta coordinate step. By default, the
 |          `dtheta` step equals the subplot&#39;s period divided by
 |          the length of the `r` coordinates.
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      line
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Line instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      marker
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Marker instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      r
 |          Sets the radial coordinates
 |      r0
 |          Alternate to `r`. Builds a linear space of r
 |          coordinates. Use with `dr` where `r0` is the starting
 |          coordinate and `dr` the step.
 |      rsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Selected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Stream instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a polar subplot. If &#34;polar&#34; (the default value),
 |          the data refer to `layout.polar`. If &#34;polar2&#34;, the data
 |          refer to `layout.polar2`, and so on.
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      theta
 |          Sets the angular coordinates
 |      theta0
 |          Alternate to `theta`. Builds a linear space of theta
 |          coordinates. Use with `dtheta` where `theta0` is the
 |          starting coordinate and `dtheta` the step.
 |      thetasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  theta .
 |      thetaunit
 |          Sets the unit of input &#34;theta&#34; values. Has an effect
 |          only when on &#34;linear&#34; angular axes.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterpolargl.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |      Add a new Scatterternary trace
 |      
 |      Provides similar functionality to the &#34;scatter&#34; type but on a
 |      ternary phase diagram. The data is provided by at least two
 |      arrays out of `a`, `b`, `c` triplets.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      a
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      asrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  a .
 |      b
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      bsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  b .
 |      c
 |          Sets the quantity of component `a` in each data point.
 |          If `a`, `b`, and `c` are all provided, they need not be
 |          normalized, only the relative values matter. If only
 |          two arrays are provided they must be normalized to
 |          match `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum`.
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      csrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  c .
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Use with
 |          `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. scatterternary has a subset
 |          of the options available to scatter. &#34;toself&#34; connects
 |          the endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the
 |          trace if it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          fills the space between two traces if one completely
 |          encloses the other (eg consecutive contour lines), and
 |          behaves like &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it.
 |          &#34;tonext&#34; should not be used if one trace does not
 |          enclose the other.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Hoverlabel instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format

 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (a,b,c)
 |          point. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of strings, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c).
 |          To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain a &#34;text&#34;
 |          flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Selected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Stream instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      subplot
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s data coordinates
 |          and a ternary subplot. If &#34;ternary&#34; (the default
 |          value), the data refer to `layout.ternary`. If
 |          &#34;ternary2&#34;, the data refer to `layout.ternary2`, and so
 |          on.
 |      sum
 |          The number each triplet should sum to, if only two of
 |          `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided. This overrides
 |          `ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum` to normalize this specific trace, but
 |          does not affect the values displayed on the axes. 0 (or
 |          missing) means to use ternary&lt;i&gt;.sum
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (a,b,c) point.
 |          If a single string, the same string appears over all
 |          the data points. If an array of strings, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the the data points in (a,b,c). If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the text font.
 |      textposition
 |          Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
 |          to the (x,y) coordinates.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatterternary.Unselected instance or
 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using

 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`

 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          visible).
 |      xaxes
 |          Sets the list of x axes corresponding to dimensions of
 |          this splom trace. By default, a splom will match the
 |          first N xaxes where N is the number of input
 |          dimensions. Note that, in case where `diagonal.visible`
 |          is false and `showupperhalf` or `showlowerhalf` is
 |          false, this splom trace will generate one less x-axis
 |          and one less y-axis.
 |      yaxes
 |          Sets the list of y axes corresponding to dimensions of
 |          this splom trace. By default, a splom will match the
 |          first N yaxes where N is the number of input
 |          dimensions. Note that, in case where `diagonal.visible`
 |          is false and `showupperhalf` or `showlowerhalf` is
 |          false, this splom trace will generate one less x-axis
 |          and one less y-axis.
 |      row : int or None (default)

 |      position arrays `x`, `y` and `z` and 3 vector component arrays
 |      `u`, `v`, and `w`.  By default, the tubes&#39; starting positions
 |      will be cut from the vector field&#39;s x-z plane at its minimum y
 |      value. To specify your own starting position, use attributes
 |      `starts.x`, `starts.y` and `starts.z`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here u/v/w norm) or the
 |          bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, `cmin`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as u/v/w norm. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as u/v/w norm and if set, `cmax`
 |          must be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.streamtube.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If

 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

 |          dict with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc

 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.
 |      sizeref

 |      text
 |          Sets a text element associated with this trace. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag, this text
 |          element will be seen in all hover labels. Note that
 |          streamtube traces do not support array `text` values.
 |      u
 |          Sets the x components of the vector field.
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a

 |          reference the root node in the hierarchy. If `ids` is
 |          filled, `parents` items are understood to be &#34;ids&#34;
 |          themselves. When `ids` is not set, plotly attempts to
 |          find matching items in `labels`, but beware they must
 |          be unique.
 |      parentssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  parents .
 |      stream

 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is

 |      Add a new Surface trace
 |      
 |      The data the describes the coordinates of the surface is set in

 |      `y` can either be 1D lists or 2D lists (e.g. to graph
 |      parametric surfaces). If not provided in `x` and `y`, the x and
 |      y coordinates are assumed to be linear starting at 0 with a
 |      unit step. The color scale corresponds to the `z` values by
 |      default. For custom color scales, use `surfacecolor` which
 |      should be a 2D list, where its bounds can be controlled using
 |      `cmin` and `cmax`.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here z or surfacecolor)
 |          or the bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to
 |          `false` when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as z or surfacecolor and if set,
 |          `cmin` must be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as z or surfacecolor.
 |          Has no effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as z or surfacecolor and if set,
 |          `cmax` must be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.
 |      colorbar
 |          plotly.graph_objs.surface.ColorBar instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR
 |          d,Bluered,RdBu,Reds,Blues,Picnic,Rainbow,Portland,Jet,H

 |          frame plot.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .

 |          with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.

 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name

 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      reversescale
 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showscale

 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  surfacecolor
 |          .
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each z value. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as

 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      jitter
 |          Sets the amount of jitter in the sample points drawn.
 |          If 0, the sample points align along the distribution
 |          axis. If 1, the sample points are drawn in a random
 |          jitter of width equal to the width of the violins.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.

 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover. For violin traces, the name
 |          will also be used for the position coordinate, if `x`
 |          and `x0` (`y` and `y0` if horizontal) are missing and
 |          the position axis is categorical. Note that the trace
 |          name is also used as a default value for attribute
 |          `scalegroup` (please see its description for details).
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the violin(s). If &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;),
 |          the distribution is visualized along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      pointpos
 |          Sets the position of the sample points in relation to
 |          the violins. If 0, the sample points are places over
 |          the center of the violins. Positive (negative) values
 |          correspond to positions to the right (left) for
 |          vertical violins and above (below) for horizontal
 |          violins.
 |      points
 |          If &#34;outliers&#34;, only the sample points lying outside the
 |          whiskers are shown If &#34;suspectedoutliers&#34;, the outlier
 |          points are shown and points either less than 4*Q1-3*Q3
 |          or greater than 4*Q3-3*Q1 are highlighted (see
 |          `outliercolor`) If &#34;all&#34;, all sample points are shown
 |          If False, only the violins are shown with no sample
 |          points
 |      scalegroup
 |          If there are multiple violins that should be sized
 |          according to to some metric (see `scalemode`), link
 |          them by providing a non-empty group id here shared by
 |          every trace in the same group. If a violin&#39;s `width` is
 |          undefined, `scalegroup` will default to the trace&#39;s
 |          name. In this case, violins with the same names will be
 |          linked together
 |      scalemode
 |          Sets the metric by which the width of each violin is
 |          determined.&#34;width&#34; means each violin has the same (max)
 |          width*count* means the violins are scaled by the number
 |          of sample points makingup each violin.
 |      selected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Selected instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      side
 |          Determines on which side of the position value the
 |          density function making up one half of a violin is
 |          plotted. Useful when comparing two violin traces under
 |          &#34;overlay&#34; mode, where one trace has `side` set to
 |          &#34;positive&#34; and the other to &#34;negative&#34;.
 |      span
 |          Sets the span in data space for which the density
 |          function will be computed. Has an effect only when
 |          `spanmode` is set to &#34;manual&#34;.
 |      spanmode
 |          Sets the method by which the span in data space where
 |          the density function will be computed. &#34;soft&#34; means the
 |          span goes from the sample&#39;s minimum value minus two
 |          bandwidths to the sample&#39;s maximum value plus two
 |          bandwidths. &#34;hard&#34; means the span goes from the
 |          sample&#39;s minimum to its maximum value. For custom span
 |          settings, use mode &#34;manual&#34; and fill in the `span`
 |          attribute.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Stream instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with each sample
 |          value. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      unselected
 |          plotly.graph_objs.violin.Unselected instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the width of the violin in data coordinates. If 0
 |          (default value) the width is automatically selected
 |          based on the positions of other violin traces in the
 |          same subplot.
 |      x
 |          Sets the x sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.

 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y sample data or coordinates. See overview for
 |          more info.
 |      y0
 |          Sets the y coordinate of the box. See overview for more
 |          info.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
 |          y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
 |      ysrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .
 |      row : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot row index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      col : int or None (default)
 |          Subplot col index (starting from 1) for the trace to be
 |          added. Only valid if figure was created using
 |          `plotly.tools.make_subplots`
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          If True, associate this trace with the secondary y-axis of the
 |          subplot at the specified row and col. Only valid if all of the
 |          following conditions are satisfied:
 |            * The figure was created using `plotly.subplots.make_subplots`.
 |            * The row and col arguments are not None
 |            * The subplot at the specified row and col has type xy
 |              (which is the default) and secondary_y True.  These
 |              properties are specified in the specs argument to
 |              make_subplots. See the make_subplots docstring for more info.

 |      
 |      Draws volume trace between iso-min and iso-max values with
 |      coordinates given by four 1-dimensional arrays containing the
 |      `value`, `x`, `y` and `z` of every vertex of a uniform or non-
 |      uniform 3-D grid. Horizontal or vertical slices, caps as well

 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      autocolorscale
 |          Determines whether the colorscale is a default palette
 |          (`autocolorscale: true`) or the palette determined by
 |          `colorscale`. In case `colorscale` is unspecified or
 |          `autocolorscale` is true, the default  palette will be
 |          chosen according to whether numbers in the `color`
 |          array are all positive, all negative or mixed.
 |      caps
 |          plotly.graph_objs.volume.Caps instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      cauto
 |          Determines whether or not the color domain is computed
 |          with respect to the input data (here `value`) or the
 |          bounds set in `cmin` and `cmax`  Defaults to `false`
 |          when `cmin` and `cmax` are set by the user.
 |      cmax
 |          Sets the upper bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmin` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      cmid
 |          Sets the mid-point of the color domain by scaling
 |          `cmin` and/or `cmax` to be equidistant to this point.
 |          Value should have the same units as `value`. Has no
 |          effect when `cauto` is `false`.
 |      cmin
 |          Sets the lower bound of the color domain. Value should
 |          have the same units as `value` and if set, `cmax` must
 |          be set as well.
 |      coloraxis
 |          Sets a reference to a shared color axis. References to
 |          these shared color axes are &#34;coloraxis&#34;, &#34;coloraxis2&#34;,
 |          &#34;coloraxis3&#34;, etc. Settings for these shared color axes
 |          are set in the layout, under `layout.coloraxis`,
 |          `layout.coloraxis2`, etc. Note that multiple color
 |          scales can be linked to the same color axis.

 |          compatible properties
 |      colorscale
 |          Sets the colorscale. The colorscale must be an array
 |          containing arrays mapping a normalized value to an rgb,
 |          rgba, hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At minimum,
 |          a mapping for the lowest (0) and highest (1) values are
 |          required. For example, `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1,
 |          &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To control the bounds of the
 |          colorscale in color space, use`cmin` and `cmax`.
 |          Alternatively, `colorscale` may be a palette name
 |          string of the following list: Greys,YlGnBu,Greens,YlOrR

 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .

 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      isomax
 |          Sets the maximum boundary for iso-surface plot.
 |      isomin
 |          Sets the minimum boundary for iso-surface plot.
 |      lighting
 |          plotly.graph_objs.volume.Lighting instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      lightposition
 |          plotly.graph_objs.volume.Lightposition instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the surface. Please note that in
 |          the case of using high `opacity` values for example a
 |          value greater than or equal to 0.5 on two surfaces (and
 |          0.25 with four surfaces), an overlay of multiple
 |          transparent surfaces may not perfectly be sorted in
 |          depth by the webgl API. This behavior may be improved
 |          in the near future and is subject to change.
 |      opacityscale
 |          Sets the opacityscale. The opacityscale must be an
 |          array containing arrays mapping a normalized value to
 |          an opacity value. At minimum, a mapping for the lowest
 |          (0) and highest (1) values are required. For example,
 |          `[[0, 1], [0.5, 0.2], [1, 1]]` means that higher/lower
 |          values would have higher opacity values and those in
 |          the middle would be more transparent Alternatively,
 |          `opacityscale` may be a palette name string of the
 |          following list: &#39;min&#39;, &#39;max&#39;, &#39;extremes&#39; and &#39;uniform&#39;.
 |          The default is &#39;uniform&#39;.

 |          Reverses the color mapping if true. If true, `cmin`
 |          will correspond to the last color in the array and
 |          `cmax` will correspond to the first color.
 |      scene
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s 3D coordinate
 |          system and a 3D scene. If &#34;scene&#34; (the default value),
 |          the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to `layout.scene`. If
 |          &#34;scene2&#34;, the (x,y,z) coordinates refer to
 |          `layout.scene2`, and so on.
 |      showscale
 |          Determines whether or not a colorbar is displayed for
 |          this trace.

 |      text
 |          Sets the text elements associated with the vertices. If
 |          trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      x
 |          Sets the X coordinates of the vertices on X axis.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .

 |      
 |      Draws waterfall trace which is useful graph to displays the
 |      contribution of various elements (either positive or negative)
 |      in a bar chart. The data visualized by the span of the bars is
 |      set in `y` if `orientation` is set th &#34;v&#34; (the default) and the
 |      labels are set in `x`. By setting `orientation` to &#34;h&#34;, the
 |      roles are interchanged.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      alignmentgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same alignmentgroup. This controls
 |          whether bars compute their positional range dependently
 |          or independently.
 |      base
 |          Sets where the bar base is drawn (in position axis
 |          units).
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether the text nodes are clipped about the
 |          subplot axes. To show the text nodes above axis lines
 |          and tick labels, make sure to set `xaxis.layer` and
 |          `yaxis.layer` to *below traces*.
 |      connector
 |          plotly.graph_objs.waterfall.Connector instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties

 |          be no larger than the bar itself.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      decreasing

 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.waterfall.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
 |          all the data points. If an array of string, the items
 |          are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
 |          coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
 |          a &#34;text&#34; flag.
 |      hovertextsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
 |      ids
 |          Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
 |          constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
 |          array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
 |      idssrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
 |      increasing

 |          points in `textposition` &#34;inside&#34; mode.
 |      insidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying inside the bar.
 |      legendgroup
 |          Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
 |          the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
 |          toggling legend items.
 |      measure
 |          An array containing types of values. By default the
 |          values are considered as &#39;relative&#39;. However; it is
 |          possible to use &#39;total&#39; to compute the sums. Also
 |          &#39;absolute&#39; could be applied to reset the computed total
 |          or to declare an initial value where needed.
 |      measuresrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  measure .
 |      meta
 |          Assigns extra meta information associated with this
 |          trace that can be used in various text attributes.
 |          Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
 |          colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
 |          legend item and on hover.
 |      offset
 |          Shifts the position where the bar is drawn (in position
 |          axis units). In &#34;group&#34; barmode, traces that set
 |          &#34;offset&#34; will be excluded and drawn in &#34;overlay&#34; mode
 |          instead.
 |      offsetgroup
 |          Set several traces linked to the same position axis or
 |          matching axes to the same offsetgroup where bars of the
 |          same position coordinate will line up.
 |      offsetsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  offset .
 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Sets the orientation of the bars. With &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;), the
 |          value of the each bar spans along the vertical
 |          (horizontal).
 |      outsidetextfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text` lying outside the bar.
 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stream
 |          plotly.graph_objs.waterfall.Stream instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      text
 |          Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
 |          a single string, the same string appears over all the
 |          data points. If an array of string, the items are
 |          mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
 |          If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
 |          &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
 |          the hover labels.
 |      textangle
 |          Sets the angle of the tick labels with respect to the
 |          bar. For example, a `tickangle` of -90 draws the tick
 |          labels vertically. With &#34;auto&#34; the texts may
 |          automatically be rotated to fit with the maximum size
 |          in bars.
 |      textfont
 |          Sets the font used for `text`.
 |      textinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on the graph.
 |          In the case of having multiple waterfalls, totals are
 |          computed separately (per trace).
 |      textposition
 |          Specifies the location of the `text`. &#34;inside&#34;
 |          positions `text` inside, next to the bar end (rotated
 |          and scaled if needed). &#34;outside&#34; positions `text`
 |          outside, next to the bar end (scaled if needed), unless
 |          there is another bar stacked on this one, then the text
 |          gets pushed inside. &#34;auto&#34; tries to position `text`
 |          inside the bar, but if the bar is too small and no bar
 |          is stacked on this one the text is moved outside.
 |      textpositionsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
 |          .
 |      textsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
 |      totals
 |          plotly.graph_objs.waterfall.Totals instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and
 |          transitions.
 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
 |      visible
 |          Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
 |          &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
 |          a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
 |          visible).
 |      width
 |          Sets the bar width (in position axis units).
 |      widthsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  width .

 |          coordinate and `dx` the step.
 |      xaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
 |          x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
 |          coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
 |      xsrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
 |      y
 |          Sets the y coordinates.
 |      y0

 |          coordinate and `dy` the step.
 |      yaxis
 |          Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
 |          a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the

 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      Suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single trace.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |      
 |      1) Animate a change in the xaxis and yaxis ranges using default
 |      duration and easing parameters.
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_animate():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      
 |      2) Animate a change in the size and color of the trace&#39;s markers
 |      over 2 seconds using the elastic-in-out easing method
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update(duration=2000, easing=&#39;elastic-in-out&#39;):
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.size = 20
 |  
 |  batch_update(self)
 |      A context manager that batches up trace and layout assignment
 |      operations into a singe plotly_update message that is executed when
 |      the context exits.
 |      
 |      Examples
 |      --------
 |      For example, suppose we have a figure widget, `fig`, with a single
 |      trace.
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; import plotly.graph_objs as go
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig = go.FigureWidget(data=[{&#39;y&#39;: [3, 4, 2]}])
 |      
 |      If we want to update the xaxis range, the yaxis range, and the
 |      marker color, we could do so using a series of three property
 |      assignments as follows:
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      
 |      This will work, however it will result in three messages being
 |      sent to the front end (two relayout messages for the axis range
 |      updates followed by one restyle message for the marker color
 |      update). This can cause the plot to appear to stutter as the
 |      three updates are applied incrementally.
 |      
 |      We can avoid this problem by performing these three assignments in a
 |      `batch_update` context as follows:
 |      
 |      &gt;&gt;&gt; with fig.batch_update():
 |      ...     fig.layout.xaxis.range = [0, 5]
 |      ...     fig.layout.yaxis.range = [0, 10]
 |      ...     fig.data[0].marker.color = &#39;green&#39;
 |      
 |      Now, these three property updates will be sent to the frontend in a
 |      single update message, and they will be applied by the front end
 |      simultaneously.
 |  
 |  for_each_trace(self, fn, selector=None, row=None, col=None, secondary_y=None)
 |      Apply a function to all traces that satisfy the specified selection
 |      criteria
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      fn:
 |          Function that inputs a single trace object.
 |      selector: dict or None (default None)
 |          Dict to use as selection criteria.
 |          Traces will be selected if they contain properties corresponding
 |          to all of the dictionary&#39;s keys, with values that exactly match
 |          the supplied values. If None (the default), all traces are
 |          selected.
 |      row, col: int or None (default None)
 |          Subplot row and column index of traces to select.
 |          To select traces by row and column, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots.  If None

 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If False, only select traces associated with the primary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If None (the default), do not filter traces based on secondary
 |            y-axis.
 |      
 |          To select traces by secondary y-axis, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots. See the docstring
 |          for the specs argument to make_subplots for more info on

 |          subplot at row/col is an 2D cartesian subplot that was created
 |          with a secondary y-axis.  See the docstring for the specs argument
 |          to make_subplots for more info on creating a subplot with a
 |          secondary y-axis.

 |  plotly_relayout(self, relayout_data, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly relayout operation on the figure&#39;s layout
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      relayout_data : dict
 |          Dict of layout updates
 |      
 |          dict keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;xaxis.range&#39;)
 |      
 |          dict values are the values to use to update the layout.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  plotly_restyle(self, restyle_data, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly restyle operation on the figure&#39;s traces
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      restyle_data : dict
 |          Dict of trace style updates.
 |      
 |          Keys are strings that specify the properties to be updated.
 |          Nested properties are expressed by joining successive keys on
 |          &#39;.&#39; characters (e.g. &#39;marker.color&#39;).
 |      
 |          Values may be scalars or lists. When values are scalars,
 |          that scalar value is applied to all traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.  When values are lists,
 |          the restyle operation will cycle through the elements
 |          of the list as it cycles through the traces specified by the
 |          `trace_indexes` parameter.
 |      
 |          Caution: To use plotly_restyle to update a list property (e.g.
 |          the `x` property of the scatter trace), the property value
 |          should be a scalar list containing the list to update with. For
 |          example, the following command would be used to update the &#39;x&#39;
 |          property of the first trace to the list [1, 2, 3]
 |      
 |          &gt;&gt;&gt; fig.plotly_restyle({&#39;x&#39;: [[1, 2, 3]]}, 0)
 |      
 |      trace_indexes : int or list of int
 |          Trace index, or list of trace indexes, that the restyle operation
 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  plotly_update(self, restyle_data=None, relayout_data=None, trace_indexes=None, **kwargs)
 |      Perform a Plotly update operation on the figure.
 |      
 |      Note: This operation both mutates and returns the figure
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      restyle_data : dict
 |          Traces update specification. See the docstring for the
 |          `plotly_restyle` method for details

 |          applies to. Defaults to all trace indexes.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      BaseFigure
 |          None
 |  
 |  print_grid(self)
 |      Print a visual layout of the figure&#39;s axes arrangement.
 |      This is only valid for figures that are created
 |      with plotly.tools.make_subplots.
 |  
 |  select_traces(self, selector=None, row=None, col=None, secondary_y=None)
 |      Select traces from a particular subplot cell and/or traces
 |      that satisfy custom selection criteria.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      selector: dict or None (default None)
 |          Dict to use as selection criteria.
 |          Traces will be selected if they contain properties corresponding
 |          to all of the dictionary&#39;s keys, with values that exactly match
 |          the supplied values. If None (the default), all traces are
 |          selected.
 |      row, col: int or None (default None)
 |          Subplot row and column index of traces to select.
 |          To select traces by row and column, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots.  If None
 |          (the default), all traces are selected.
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)

 |          * If None (the default), do not filter traces based on secondary
 |            y-axis.
 |      
 |          To select traces by secondary y-axis, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots. See the docstring
 |          for the specs argument to make_subplots for more info on
 |          creating subplots with secondary y-axes.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      generator
 |          Generator that iterates through all of the traces that satisfy
 |          all of the specified selection criteria
 |  
 |  show(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Show a figure using either the default renderer(s) or the renderer(s)
 |      specified by the renderer argument
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      renderer: str or None (default None)
 |          A string containing the names of one or more registered renderers
 |          (separated by &#39;+&#39; characters) or None.  If None, then the default
 |          renderers specified in plotly.io.renderers.default are used.
 |      
 |      validate: bool (default True)
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being shown,
 |          False otherwise.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |  
 |  to_dict(self)
 |      Convert figure to a dictionary
 |      
 |      Note: the dictionary includes the properties explicitly set by the
 |      user, it does not include default values of unspecified properties
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      dict
 |  
 |  to_html(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Convert a figure to an HTML string representation.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      config: dict or None (default None)
 |          Plotly.js figure config options
 |      auto_play: bool (default=True)
 |          Whether to automatically start the animation sequence on page load
 |          if the figure contains frames. Has no effect if the figure does not
 |          contain frames.
 |      include_plotlyjs: bool or string (default True)
 |          Specifies how the plotly.js library is included/loaded in the output
 |          div string.
 |      
 |          If True, a script tag containing the plotly.js source code (~3MB)
 |          is included in the output.  HTML files generated with this option are
 |          fully self-contained and can be used offline.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references the plotly.js CDN is included
 |          in the output. HTML files generated with this option are about 3MB
 |          smaller than those generated with include_plotlyjs=True, but they
 |          require an active internet connection in order to load the plotly.js
 |          library.
 |      
 |          If &#39;directory&#39;, a script tag is included that references an external
 |          plotly.min.js bundle that is assumed to reside in the same
 |          directory as the HTML file.
 |      
 |          If &#39;require&#39;, Plotly.js is loaded using require.js.  This option
 |          assumes that require.js is globally available and that it has been
 |          globally configured to know how to find Plotly.js as &#39;plotly&#39;.
 |          This option is not advised when full_html=True as it will result
 |          in a non-functional html file.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point
 |          the resulting HTML file to an alternative CDN or local bundle.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing plotly.js is included. This is
 |          useful when the resulting div string will be placed inside an HTML
 |          document that already loads plotly.js. This option is not advised
 |          when full_html=True as it will result in a non-functional html file.
 |      include_mathjax: bool or string (default False)
 |          Specifies how the MathJax.js library is included in the output html
 |          div string.  MathJax is required in order to display labels
 |          with LaTeX typesetting.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing MathJax.js will be included in the
 |          output.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references a MathJax CDN location will be
 |          included in the output.  HTML div strings generated with this option
 |          will be able to display LaTeX typesetting as long as internet access
 |          is available.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point the
 |          resulting HTML div string to an alternative CDN.
 |      post_script: str or list or None (default None)
 |          JavaScript snippet(s) to be included in the resulting div just after
 |          plot creation.  The string(s) may include &#39;{plot_id}&#39; placeholders
 |          that will then be replaced by the `id` of the div element that the
 |          plotly.js figure is associated with.  One application for this script
 |          is to install custom plotly.js event handlers.
 |      full_html: bool (default True)
 |          If True, produce a string containing a complete HTML document
 |          starting with an &lt;html&gt; tag.  If False, produce a string containing
 |          a single &lt;div&gt; element.
 |      animation_opts: dict or None (default None)
 |          dict of custom animation parameters to be passed to the function
 |          Plotly.animate in Plotly.js. See
 |          https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/src/plots/animation_attributes.js
 |          for available options. Has no effect if the figure does not contain
 |          frames, or auto_play is False.
 |      default_width, default_height: number or str (default &#39;100%&#39;)
 |          The default figure width/height to use if the provided figure does not
 |          specify its own layout.width/layout.height property.  May be
 |          specified in pixels as an integer (e.g. 500), or as a css width style
 |          string (e.g. &#39;500px&#39;, &#39;100%&#39;).
 |      validate: bool (default True)
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being converted to
 |          JSON, False otherwise.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      str
 |          Representation of figure as an HTML div string
 |  
 |  to_image(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Convert a figure to a static image bytes string
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------

 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_format`
 |      
 |      width: int or None
 |          The width of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`
 |          property is 1.0, this will also be the width of the exported image
 |          in physical pixels.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_width`
 |      
 |      height: int or None
 |          The height of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`
 |          property is 1.0, this will also be the height of the exported image
 |          in physical pixels.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_height`
 |      
 |      scale: int or float or None
 |          The scale factor to use when exporting the figure. A scale factor
 |          larger than 1.0 will increase the image resolution with respect
 |          to the figure&#39;s layout pixel dimensions. Whereas as scale factor of
 |          less than 1.0 will decrease the image resolution.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_scale`
 |      
 |      validate: bool

 |      specified selection criteria
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      patch: dict or None (default None)
 |          Dictionary of property updates to be applied to all traces that
 |          satisfy the selection criteria.
 |      selector: dict or None (default None)
 |          Dict to use as selection criteria.
 |          Traces will be selected if they contain properties corresponding
 |          to all of the dictionary&#39;s keys, with values that exactly match
 |          the supplied values. If None (the default), all traces are
 |          selected.
 |      row, col: int or None (default None)
 |          Subplot row and column index of traces to select.
 |          To select traces by row and column, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots.  If None
 |          (the default), all traces are selected.
 |      secondary_y: boolean or None (default None)
 |          * If True, only select traces associated with the secondary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If False, only select traces associated with the primary
 |            y-axis of the subplot.
 |          * If None (the default), do not filter traces based on secondary
 |            y-axis.
 |      
 |          To select traces by secondary y-axis, the Figure must have been
 |          created using plotly.subplots.make_subplots. See the docstring
 |          for the specs argument to make_subplots for more info on
 |          creating subplots with secondary y-axes.
 |      **kwargs
 |          Additional property updates to apply to each selected trace. If
 |          a property is specified in both patch and in **kwargs then the
 |          one in **kwargs takes precedence.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      self
 |          Returns the Figure object that the method was called on
 |  
 |  write_html(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Write a figure to an HTML file representation
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      file: str or writeable
 |          A string representing a local file path or a writeable object
 |          (e.g. an open file descriptor)
 |      config: dict or None (default None)
 |          Plotly.js figure config options
 |      auto_play: bool (default=True)
 |          Whether to automatically start the animation sequence on page load
 |          if the figure contains frames. Has no effect if the figure does not
 |          contain frames.
 |      include_plotlyjs: bool or string (default True)
 |          Specifies how the plotly.js library is included/loaded in the output
 |          div string.
 |      
 |          If True, a script tag containing the plotly.js source code (~3MB)
 |          is included in the output.  HTML files generated with this option are
 |          fully self-contained and can be used offline.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references the plotly.js CDN is included
 |          in the output. HTML files generated with this option are about 3MB
 |          smaller than those generated with include_plotlyjs=True, but they
 |          require an active internet connection in order to load the plotly.js
 |          library.
 |      
 |          If &#39;directory&#39;, a script tag is included that references an external
 |          plotly.min.js bundle that is assumed to reside in the same
 |          directory as the HTML file. If `file` is a string to a local file path
 |          and `full_html` is True then
 |      
 |          If &#39;directory&#39;, a script tag is included that references an external
 |          plotly.min.js bundle that is assumed to reside in the same
 |          directory as the HTML file.  If `file` is a string to a local file
 |          path and `full_html` is True, then the plotly.min.js bundle is copied
 |          into the directory of the resulting HTML file. If a file named
 |          plotly.min.js already exists in the output directory then this file
 |          is left unmodified and no copy is performed. HTML files generated
 |          with this option can be used offline, but they require a copy of
 |          the plotly.min.js bundle in the same directory. This option is
 |          useful when many figures will be saved as HTML files in the same
 |          directory because the plotly.js source code will be included only
 |          once per output directory, rather than once per output file.
 |      
 |          If &#39;require&#39;, Plotly.js is loaded using require.js.  This option
 |          assumes that require.js is globally available and that it has been
 |          globally configured to know how to find Plotly.js as &#39;plotly&#39;.
 |          This option is not advised when full_html=True as it will result
 |          in a non-functional html file.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point
 |          the resulting HTML file to an alternative CDN or local bundle.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing plotly.js is included. This is
 |          useful when the resulting div string will be placed inside an HTML
 |          document that already loads plotly.js.  This option is not advised
 |          when full_html=True as it will result in a non-functional html file.
 |      
 |      include_mathjax: bool or string (default False)
 |          Specifies how the MathJax.js library is included in the output html
 |          div string.  MathJax is required in order to display labels
 |          with LaTeX typesetting.
 |      
 |          If False, no script tag referencing MathJax.js will be included in the
 |          output.
 |      
 |          If &#39;cdn&#39;, a script tag that references a MathJax CDN location will be
 |          included in the output.  HTML div strings generated with this option
 |          will be able to display LaTeX typesetting as long as internet access
 |          is available.
 |      
 |          If a string that ends in &#39;.js&#39;, a script tag is included that
 |          references the specified path. This approach can be used to point the
 |          resulting HTML div string to an alternative CDN.
 |      post_script: str or list or None (default None)
 |          JavaScript snippet(s) to be included in the resulting div just after
 |          plot creation.  The string(s) may include &#39;{plot_id}&#39; placeholders
 |          that will then be replaced by the `id` of the div element that the
 |          plotly.js figure is associated with.  One application for this script
 |          is to install custom plotly.js event handlers.
 |      full_html: bool (default True)
 |          If True, produce a string containing a complete HTML document
 |          starting with an &lt;html&gt; tag.  If False, produce a string containing
 |          a single &lt;div&gt; element.
 |      animation_opts: dict or None (default None)
 |          dict of custom animation parameters to be passed to the function
 |          Plotly.animate in Plotly.js. See
 |          https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/src/plots/animation_attributes.js
 |          for available options. Has no effect if the figure does not contain
 |          frames, or auto_play is False.
 |      default_width, default_height: number or str (default &#39;100%&#39;)
 |          The default figure width/height to use if the provided figure does not
 |          specify its own layout.width/layout.height property.  May be
 |          specified in pixels as an integer (e.g. 500), or as a css width style
 |          string (e.g. &#39;500px&#39;, &#39;100%&#39;).
 |      validate: bool (default True)
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being converted to
 |          JSON, False otherwise.
 |      auto_open: bool (default True
 |          If True, open the saved file in a web browser after saving.
 |          This argument only applies if `full_html` is True.
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      str
 |          Representation of figure as an HTML div string
 |  
 |  write_image(self, *args, **kwargs)
 |      Convert a figure to a static image and write it to a file or writeable
 |      object
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      file: str or writeable
 |          A string representing a local file path or a writeable object
 |          (e.g. an open file descriptor)
 |      
 |      format: str or None
 |          The desired image format. One of
 |            - &#39;png&#39;
 |            - &#39;jpg&#39; or &#39;jpeg&#39;
 |            - &#39;webp&#39;
 |            - &#39;svg&#39;
 |            - &#39;pdf&#39;
 |            - &#39;eps&#39; (Requires the poppler library to be installed)
 |      
 |          If not specified and `file` is a string then this will default to the
 |          file extension. If not specified and `file` is not a string then this
 |          will default to `plotly.io.config.default_format`
 |      
 |      width: int or None
 |          The width of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`
 |          property is 1.0, this will also be the width of the exported image
 |          in physical pixels.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_width`
 |      
 |      height: int or None
 |          The height of the exported image in layout pixels. If the `scale`
 |          property is 1.0, this will also be the height of the exported image
 |          in physical pixels.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_height`

 |      scale: int or float or None
 |          The scale factor to use when exporting the figure. A scale factor
 |          larger than 1.0 will increase the image resolution with respect
 |          to the figure&#39;s layout pixel dimensions. Whereas as scale factor of
 |          less than 1.0 will decrease the image resolution.
 |      
 |          If not specified, will default to `plotly.io.config.default_scale`
 |      
 |      validate: bool
 |          True if the figure should be validated before being converted to
 |          an image, False otherwise.
 |      
 |      Returns
 |      -------
 |      None
 |

 |          True if JSON representation should be pretty-printed, False if
 |          representation should be as compact as possible.
 |      
 |      remove_uids: bool (default True)
 |          True if trace UIDs should be omitted from the JSON representation

<pre>Help on class Scatter in module plotly.graph_objs:

class Scatter(plotly.basedatatypes.BaseTraceType)
 |  Base class for the all trace types.
 |  
 |  Specific trace type classes (Scatter, Bar, etc.) are code generated as
 |  subclasses of this class.
 |  
 |  Method resolution order:
 |      Scatter
 |      plotly.basedatatypes.BaseTraceType
 |      plotly.basedatatypes.BaseTraceHierarchyType
 |      plotly.basedatatypes.BasePlotlyType
 |      builtins.object
 |  
 |  Methods defined here:
 |  
 |  __init__(self, arg=None, cliponaxis=None, connectgaps=None, customdata=None, customdatasrc=None, dx=None, dy=None, error_x=None, error_y=None, fill=None, fillcolor=None, groupnorm=None, hoverinfo=None, hoverinfosrc=None, hoverlabel=None, hoveron=None, hovertemplate=None, hovertemplatesrc=None, hovertext=None, hovertextsrc=None, ids=None, idssrc=None, legendgroup=None, line=None, marker=None, meta=None, metasrc=None, mode=None, name=None, opacity=None, orientation=None, r=None, rsrc=None, selected=None, selectedpoints=None, showlegend=None, stackgaps=None, stackgroup=None, stream=None, t=None, text=None, textfont=None, textposition=None, textpositionsrc=None, textsrc=None, tsrc=None, uid=None, uirevision=None, unselected=None, visible=None, x=None, x0=None, xaxis=None, xcalendar=None, xsrc=None, y=None, y0=None, yaxis=None, ycalendar=None, ysrc=None, **kwargs)
 |      Construct a new Scatter object
 |      
 |      The scatter trace type encompasses line charts, scatter charts,
 |      text charts, and bubble charts. The data visualized as scatter
 |      point or lines is set in `x` and `y`. Text (appearing either on
 |      the chart or on hover only) is via `text`. Bubble charts are
 |      achieved by setting `marker.size` and/or `marker.color` to
 |      numerical arrays.
 |      
 |      Parameters
 |      ----------
 |      arg
 |          dict of properties compatible with this constructor or
 |          an instance of plotly.graph_objs.Scatter
 |      cliponaxis
 |          Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
 |          clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
 |          text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
 |          to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
 |          traces*.
 |      connectgaps
 |          Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
 |          values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
 |      customdata
 |          Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
 |          listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
 |          that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
 |          the markers DOM elements
 |      customdatasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
 |      dx
 |          Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
 |      dy
 |          Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
 |      error_x
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorX instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      error_y
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorY instance or dict with
 |          compatible properties
 |      fill
 |          Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
 |          &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
 |          with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
 |          fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
 |          &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
 |          the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
 |          endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
 |          graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
 |          like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |          endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
 |          it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
 |          space between two traces if one completely encloses the
 |          other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
 |          &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
 |          should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
 |          other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
 |          be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
 |          multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
 |          not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
 |          the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
 |          order.
 |      fillcolor
 |          Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
 |          variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
 |          color, whichever is available.
 |      groupnorm
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
 |          this `stackgroup`. With &#34;fraction&#34;, the value of each
 |          trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
 |          trace values at that location. &#34;percent&#34; is the same
 |          but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
 |          multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
 |          subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
 |      hoverinfo
 |          Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
 |          `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
 |          upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
 |          events are still fired.
 |      hoverinfosrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
 |      hoverlabel
 |          plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Hoverlabel instance or dict
 |          with compatible properties
 |      hoveron
 |          Do the hover effects highlight individual points
 |          (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
 |          regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
 |          are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
 |          otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
 |      hovertemplate
 |          Template string used for rendering the information that
 |          appear on hover box. Note that this will override
 |          `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
 |          for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
 |          d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
 |          &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
 |          /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
 |          formatting syntax. The variables available in
 |          `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
 |          described at this link
 |          https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
 |          Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
 |          per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
 |          available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
 |          displayed in the secondary box, for example
 |          &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
 |          box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
 |      hovertemplatesrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
 |          .
 |      hovertext
 |          Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
 |          pair. If a single string, the same string appears over

 |          `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
 |          text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
 |          values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
 |          `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
 |          `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
 |          layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
 |          is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
 |          index.
 |      metasrc
 |          Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
 |      mode
 |          Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
 |          the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
 |          elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
 |          `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
 |          20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
 |          is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
 |      name
 |          Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the

 |      opacity
 |          Sets the opacity of the trace.
 |      orientation
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With &#34;v&#34;
 |          (&#34;h&#34;), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
 |          Also affects the default value of `fill`.

 |      selectedpoints
 |          Array containing integer indices of selected points.
 |          Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
 |          Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
 |          the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
 |          any other non-array values means no selection all where
 |          the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
 |      showlegend
 |          Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
 |          trace is shown in the legend.
 |      stackgaps
 |          Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
 |          first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
 |          used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
 |          if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
 |          which other traces in this group have data but this one
 |          does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
 |          locations. With &#34;interpolate&#34; we linearly interpolate
 |          between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
 |          beyond the existing values.
 |      stackgroup
 |          Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
 |          same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
 |          their x values if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34;). If blank or
 |          omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
 |          turns `fill` on by default, using &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;)
 |          if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34; (&#34;v&#34;) and sets the default
 |          `mode` to &#34;lines&#34; irrespective of point count. You can
 |          only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
 |          a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
 |          other traces in the same group. With multiple
 |          `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
 |          fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
 |          later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.

 |      uid
 |          Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
 |          constancy between traces during animations and

 |      uirevision
 |          Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
 |          trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
 |          as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
 |          and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
 |          Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
 |          controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
 |          controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
 |          `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |          `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
 |          (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
 |          controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
 |          tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
 |          if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
 |          traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
 |          the same trace has a different index, you can still
 |          preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
 |          `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

 |  fill
 |      Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to &#34;none&#34;
 |      unless this trace is stacked, then it gets &#34;tonexty&#34;
 |      (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use with `fillcolor`
 |      if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34; fill to x=0 and y=0
 |      respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the
 |      endpoints of this trace and the endpoints of the trace before
 |      it, connecting those endpoints with straight lines (to make a
 |      stacked area graph); if there is no trace before it, they
 |      behave like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
 |      endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if it has
 |      gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the space between two
 |      traces if one completely encloses the other (eg consecutive
 |      contour lines), and behaves like &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace
 |      before it. &#34;tonext&#34; should not be used if one trace does not
 |      enclose the other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to
 |      (or be filled to) other traces in the same group. With multiple
 |      `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if fill-
 |      linked traces are not already consecutive, the later ones will
 |      be pushed down in the drawing order.
 |

 |                  mapping a normalized value to an rgb, rgba,
 |                  hex, hsl, hsv, or named color string. At
 |                  minimum, a mapping for the lowest (0) and
 |                  highest (1) values are required. For example,
 |                  `[[0, &#39;rgb(0,0,255)&#39;, [1, &#39;rgb(255,0,0)&#39;]]`. To
 |                  control the bounds of the colorscale in color
 |                  space, use`marker.cmin` and `marker.cmax`.

 |  uirevision
 |      Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the trace:
 |      `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well as some
 |      `editable: true` modifications such as `name` and
 |      `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`. Note that
 |      other user-driven trace attribute changes are controlled by
 |      `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is controlled by
 |      `layout.legend.uirevision`, `selectedpoints` is controlled by
 |      `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)` (accessible
 |      with `config: {editable: true}`) is controlled by
 |      `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are tracked by `uid`,
 |      which only falls back on trace index if no `uid` is provided.
 |      So if your app can add/remove traces before the end of the
 |      `data` array, such that the same trace has a different index,
 |      you can still preserve user-driven changes if you give each
 |      trace a `uid` that stays with it as it moves.

<span class="ansi-red-fg">ValueError</span>: Invalid property specified for object of type plotly.graph_objs.Scatter: &#39;markers&#39;

    Valid properties:
        cliponaxis
            Determines whether or not markers and text nodes are
            clipped about the subplot axes. To show markers and
            text nodes above axis lines and tick labels, make sure
            to set `xaxis.layer` and `yaxis.layer` to *below
            traces*.
        connectgaps
            Determines whether or not gaps (i.e. {nan} or missing
            values) in the provided data arrays are connected.
        customdata
            Assigns extra data each datum. This may be useful when
            listening to hover, click and selection events. Note
            that, &#34;scatter&#34; traces also appends customdata items in
            the markers DOM elements
        customdatasrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  customdata .
        dx
            Sets the x coordinate step. See `x0` for more info.
        dy
            Sets the y coordinate step. See `y0` for more info.
        error_x
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorX instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        error_y
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.ErrorY instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        fill
            Sets the area to fill with a solid color. Defaults to
            &#34;none&#34; unless this trace is stacked, then it gets
            &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;) if `orientation` is &#34;v&#34; (&#34;h&#34;) Use
            with `fillcolor` if not &#34;none&#34;. &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;
            fill to x=0 and y=0 respectively. &#34;tonextx&#34; and
            &#34;tonexty&#34; fill between the endpoints of this trace and
            the endpoints of the trace before it, connecting those
            endpoints with straight lines (to make a stacked area
            graph); if there is no trace before it, they behave
            like &#34;tozerox&#34; and &#34;tozeroy&#34;. &#34;toself&#34; connects the
            endpoints of the trace (or each segment of the trace if
            it has gaps) into a closed shape. &#34;tonext&#34; fills the
            space between two traces if one completely encloses the
            other (eg consecutive contour lines), and behaves like
            &#34;toself&#34; if there is no trace before it. &#34;tonext&#34;
            should not be used if one trace does not enclose the
            other. Traces in a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or
            be filled to) other traces in the same group. With
            multiple `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some
            not, if fill-linked traces are not already consecutive,
            the later ones will be pushed down in the drawing
            order.
        fillcolor
            Sets the fill color. Defaults to a half-transparent
            variant of the line color, marker color, or marker line
            color, whichever is available.
        groupnorm
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `groupnorm` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the normalization for the sum of
            this `stackgroup`. With &#34;fraction&#34;, the value of each
            trace at each location is divided by the sum of all
            trace values at that location. &#34;percent&#34; is the same
            but multiplied by 100 to show percentages. If there are
            multiple subplots, or multiple `stackgroup`s on one
            subplot, each will be normalized within its own set.
        hoverinfo
            Determines which trace information appear on hover. If
            `none` or `skip` are set, no information is displayed
            upon hovering. But, if `none` is set, click and hover
            events are still fired.
        hoverinfosrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hoverinfo .
        hoverlabel
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Hoverlabel instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        hoveron
            Do the hover effects highlight individual points
            (markers or line points) or do they highlight filled
            regions? If the fill is &#34;toself&#34; or &#34;tonext&#34; and there
            are no markers or text, then the default is &#34;fills&#34;,
            otherwise it is &#34;points&#34;.
        hovertemplate
            Template string used for rendering the information that
            appear on hover box. Note that this will override
            `hoverinfo`. Variables are inserted using %{variable},
            for example &#34;y: %{y}&#34;. Numbers are formatted using
            d3-format&#39;s syntax %{variable:d3-format}, for example
            &#34;Price: %{y:$.2f}&#34;. See https://github.com/d3/d3-format
            /blob/master/README.md#locale_format for details on the
            formatting syntax. The variables available in
            `hovertemplate` are the ones emitted as event data
            described at this link
            https://plot.ly/javascript/plotlyjs-events/#event-data.
            Additionally, every attributes that can be specified
            per-point (the ones that are `arrayOk: true`) are
            available.  Anything contained in tag `&lt;extra&gt;` is
            displayed in the secondary box, for example
            &#34;&lt;extra&gt;{fullData.name}&lt;/extra&gt;&#34;. To hide the secondary
            box completely, use an empty tag `&lt;extra&gt;&lt;/extra&gt;`.
        hovertemplatesrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertemplate
            .
        hovertext
            Sets hover text elements associated with each (x,y)
            pair. If a single string, the same string appears over
            all the data points. If an array of string, the items
            are mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y)
            coordinates. To be seen, trace `hoverinfo` must contain
            a &#34;text&#34; flag.
        hovertextsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  hovertext .
        ids
            Assigns id labels to each datum. These ids for object
            constancy of data points during animation. Should be an
            array of strings, not numbers or any other type.
        idssrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  ids .
        legendgroup
            Sets the legend group for this trace. Traces part of
            the same legend group hide/show at the same time when
            toggling legend items.
        line
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Line instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        marker
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Marker instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        meta
            Assigns extra meta information associated with this
            trace that can be used in various text attributes.
            Attributes such as trace `name`, graph, axis and
            colorbar `title.text`, annotation `text`
            `rangeselector`, `updatemenues` and `sliders` `label`
            text all support `meta`. To access the trace `meta`
            values in an attribute in the same trace, simply use
            `%{meta[i]}` where `i` is the index or key of the
            `meta` item in question. To access trace `meta` in
            layout attributes, use `%{data[n[.meta[i]}` where `i`
            is the index or key of the `meta` and `n` is the trace
            index.
        metasrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  meta .
        mode
            Determines the drawing mode for this scatter trace. If
            the provided `mode` includes &#34;text&#34; then the `text`
            elements appear at the coordinates. Otherwise, the
            `text` elements appear on hover. If there are less than
            20 points and the trace is not stacked then the default
            is &#34;lines+markers&#34;. Otherwise, &#34;lines&#34;.
        name
            Sets the trace name. The trace name appear as the
            legend item and on hover.
        opacity
            Sets the opacity of the trace.
        orientation
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `orientation` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
            if it is `false`. Sets the stacking direction. With &#34;v&#34;
            (&#34;h&#34;), the y (x) values of subsequent traces are added.
            Also affects the default value of `fill`.
        r
            r coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please
            switch to the &#34;scatterpolar&#34; trace type.Sets the radial
            coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
        rsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  r .
        selected
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Selected instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        selectedpoints
            Array containing integer indices of selected points.
            Has an effect only for traces that support selections.
            Note that an empty array means an empty selection where
            the `unselected` are turned on for all points, whereas,
            any other non-array values means no selection all where
            the `selected` and `unselected` styles have no effect.
        showlegend
            Determines whether or not an item corresponding to this
            trace is shown in the legend.
        stackgaps
            Only relevant when `stackgroup` is used, and only the
            first `stackgaps` found in the `stackgroup` will be
            used - including if `visible` is &#34;legendonly&#34; but not
            if it is `false`. Determines how we handle locations at
            which other traces in this group have data but this one
            does not. With *infer zero* we insert a zero at these
            locations. With &#34;interpolate&#34; we linearly interpolate
            between existing values, and extrapolate a constant
            beyond the existing values.
        stackgroup
            Set several scatter traces (on the same subplot) to the
            same stackgroup in order to add their y values (or
            their x values if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34;). If blank or
            omitted this trace will not be stacked. Stacking also
            turns `fill` on by default, using &#34;tonexty&#34; (&#34;tonextx&#34;)
            if `orientation` is &#34;h&#34; (&#34;v&#34;) and sets the default
            `mode` to &#34;lines&#34; irrespective of point count. You can
            only stack on a numeric (linear or log) axis. Traces in
            a `stackgroup` will only fill to (or be filled to)
            other traces in the same group. With multiple
            `stackgroup`s or some traces stacked and some not, if
            fill-linked traces are not already consecutive, the
            later ones will be pushed down in the drawing order.
        stream
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Stream instance or dict with
            compatible properties
        t
            t coordinates in scatter traces are deprecated!Please
            switch to the &#34;scatterpolar&#34; trace type.Sets the
            angular coordinatesfor legacy polar chart only.
        text
            Sets text elements associated with each (x,y) pair. If
            a single string, the same string appears over all the
            data points. If an array of string, the items are
            mapped in order to the this trace&#39;s (x,y) coordinates.
            If trace `hoverinfo` contains a &#34;text&#34; flag and
            &#34;hovertext&#34; is not set, these elements will be seen in
            the hover labels.
        textfont
            Sets the text font.
        textposition
            Sets the positions of the `text` elements with respects
            to the (x,y) coordinates.
        textpositionsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  textposition
            .
        textsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  text .
        tsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  t .
        uid
            Assign an id to this trace, Use this to provide object
            constancy between traces during animations and
            transitions.
        uirevision
            Controls persistence of some user-driven changes to the
            trace: `constraintrange` in `parcoords` traces, as well
            as some `editable: true` modifications such as `name`
            and `colorbar.title`. Defaults to `layout.uirevision`.
            Note that other user-driven trace attribute changes are
            controlled by `layout` attributes: `trace.visible` is
            controlled by `layout.legend.uirevision`,
            `selectedpoints` is controlled by
            `layout.selectionrevision`, and `colorbar.(x|y)`
            (accessible with `config: {editable: true}`) is
            controlled by `layout.editrevision`. Trace changes are
            tracked by `uid`, which only falls back on trace index
            if no `uid` is provided. So if your app can add/remove
            traces before the end of the `data` array, such that
            the same trace has a different index, you can still
            preserve user-driven changes if you give each trace a
            `uid` that stays with it as it moves.
        unselected
            plotly.graph_objs.scatter.Unselected instance or dict
            with compatible properties
        visible
            Determines whether or not this trace is visible. If
            &#34;legendonly&#34;, the trace is not drawn, but can appear as
            a legend item (provided that the legend itself is
            visible).
        x
            Sets the x coordinates.
        x0
            Alternate to `x`. Builds a linear space of x
            coordinates. Use with `dx` where `x0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dx` the step.
        xaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s x coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian x axis. If &#34;x&#34; (the default value), the
            x coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis`. If &#34;x2&#34;, the x
            coordinates refer to `layout.xaxis2`, and so on.
        xcalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `x` date data.
        xsrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  x .
        y
            Sets the y coordinates.
        y0
            Alternate to `y`. Builds a linear space of y
            coordinates. Use with `dy` where `y0` is the starting
            coordinate and `dy` the step.
        yaxis
            Sets a reference between this trace&#39;s y coordinates and
            a 2D cartesian y axis. If &#34;y&#34; (the default value), the
            y coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis`. If &#34;y2&#34;, the y
            coordinates refer to `layout.yaxis2`, and so on.
        ycalendar
            Sets the calendar system to use with `y` date data.
        ysrc
            Sets the source reference on plot.ly for  y .

However if we let <code>scatter_trace</code> be just a standard dictionary then we will not be able to just add another feature for the marker in this way.

<p>Examples are one of the best ways to get started and get your feet wet. Through the examples you can get a good idea of what a certain type of plot is used for, and what can be possible with it.</p>
<p>Moreover, the code in the examples are self-contained, meaning you can just copy and paste the code block and run it in your Python script or Ipython Notebook. But if you happen to run into an issue running the example, please let us know at our <a href="http://community.plot.ly">Community Forums</a>. By examining the code, you can further understand and experience the procedure in which Plotly plots are created. Something important to look at would be the data used in these examples; Because certain plots are only able to handle certain types of data (e.g: histograms are only useful for quantitative data), you will get an idea of the limitations and purpose of different plot types. In addition, you can see the effect certain parameters have on the data visualization and hopefully give you a sense of what's possible beyond the standard/default.</p>
<p>It's a good place to look for what's possible in Plotly. A brief look at the page you can find sections and examples on types of plots you didn't know existed, or layout options that you had no idea were possible and within reach. Just take a look at all these guys:</p>

<p>As an example, say we looked at two different types of plots in the <code>heatmap</code> and the <code>box plots</code>, now equipped with the knowledge of subplots, we can easily two and two together in order to put both these on the same plotting surface (for no other reason than that we can). Let's first load the packages, and then set up the data for our heatmap trace.</p>

<p>This looks great, however we'd like for our subplots to be on the same plotting surface. So let's take a look at the dictionary representation of our figure, and customize it using what we've learned before.</p>

<p>We actually see that the second boxplot has its own xaxis and yaxis. Thus we should unify it with the same axis as the first subplot. Then from the layout section, we should remove the additional xaxis and yaxis that are drawn for us. You can perform these steps seperately to see what I mean, but in this guide, I'll just show you the result of this edit/customization.</p>

<p>At this point you may have a good idea of how you want to visualize your data, and which type of plot you would like to use. You've taken a look at some examples of this plot type, but there are still some details that you would like to add or change. Now is the time for you to check out the <strong><a href="https://plot.ly/python/reference/">Reference Page!</a></strong> The reference page details all the parameters that can be set for every type of plot that is possible in Plotly (ie: all the trace objects). In addition it also provides details on the possible parameters that are available to change in the <code>Layout</code> object as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/12302455/14263600/681e8c54-fa89-11e5-8467-99e78e4f9135.png" alt="something"></p>
<p>When you first load the page you will see a menu on the left which is segregated into <code>Plot Objects</code> and <code>Layout</code>. This exemplifies the two components of every Plotly figure. So for example if you knew you wanted to change something related to the visualization of the data, then you would look at the first section. If instead you were interested in a general aesthetic feature of the graph then the Layout will probably be your best option.</p>
<p>Now for example, if you decided to create a scatter plot, then you would choose <code>Scatter</code> under <code>Plot Objects</code>, and that will take you to the the section for <code>Scatter</code>. On your immediate right you will be able to see a breakdown of the Scatter section, which includes all the parameters and sub-parameters at your disposal.</p>
